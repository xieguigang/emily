    ''' GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations) is a widely-used molecular dynamics simulation package. In GROMACS, the `.rtp` (Residue Topology) file is an essential component used to define the topology of residues for the purpose of molecular dynamics simulations. Here's an overview of what the `.rtp` file contains and its purpose:
    ''' ### Purpose:
    ''' 1. **Residue Definition**: The `.rtp` file defines the chemical structure of residues, which are the building blocks of proteins and other biomolecules.
    ''' 2. **Topology Information**: It provides the topology information needed for the simulation, including the types of atoms, bonds, angles, and dihedrals within a residue.
    ''' 3. **Force Field Parameters**: The file includes parameters that are specific to the force field being used, such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles.
    ''' ### Contents:
    ''' 1. **Residue Name**: Each residue is identified by a name (e.g., ALA for alanine).
    ''' 2. **Atom Information**:
    '''    - **Atom Name**: The name of each atom in the residue (e.g., N, CA, C, O for the backbone atoms in an amino acid).
    '''    - **Atom Type**: The type of each atom, which corresponds to specific parameters in the force field (e.g., N, CT, C, O).
    '''   - **Charge**: The partial charge assigned to each atom.
    '''    - **Mass**: The mass of each atom (often omitted if the force field defines standard masses for each atom type).
    ''' 3. **Bond Information**:
    '''    - **Bond List**: A list of bonds between atoms within the residue, specified by the names of the connected atoms.
    ''' 4. **Angle Information**:
    '''    - **Angle List**: A list of angles formed by three connected atoms, specified by the names of the atoms.
    ''' 5. **Dihedral Information**:
    '''    - **Dihedral List**: A list of dihedral angles formed by four connected atoms, specified by the names of the atoms.
    ''' 6. **Improper Dihedral Information**:
    '''    - **Improper Dihedral List**: A list of improper dihedrals, which are used to maintain the chirality of certain atoms.
    ''' 7. **Hydrogen Bond Information** (optional):
    '''    - **Hydrogen Bond List**: A list of potential hydrogen bonds within the residue.
    ''' ### Usage:
    ''' - **Topology Building**: When building the topology of a molecule, GROMACS uses the `.rtp` file to assign the correct atom types, charges, and connectivity.
    ''' - **Force Field Compatibility**: The `.rtp` file must be compatible with the force field being used for the simulation. Different force fields may have different `.rtp` files.
    ''' - **Modification and Customization**: Users can modify `.rtp` files to introduce new residues or to customize the parameters for existing ones.
    ''' ### Example:
    ''' An example entry for an alanine residue in an `.rtp` file might look like this:
    ''' ```
    ''' [ ALA ]
    ''' [ atoms ]
    '''   N   NH1    -0.47  14.007
    '''   CA  CT1     0.07  12.011
    '''   C   C       0.51  12.011
    '''   O   O      -0.51  16.000
    '''   CB  CT3     0.07  12.011
    ''' [ bonds ]
    '''  N   CA
    '''   CA  C
    '''   C   O
    '''   CA  CB
    ''' [ angles ]
    '''   N   CA  C
    '''   CA  C   O
    '''   CA  CB  N
    ''' [ dihedrals ]
    '''   N   CA  C   O
    '''   CA  C   O   N
    '''   CB  CA  C   O
    ''' ```
    ''' In this example, the `ALA` residue is defined with its atoms, bonds, angles, and dihedrals. The atom types (e.g., NH1, CT1, C, O, CT3) correspond to specific parameters in the force field.
    ''' The `.rtp` file is a crucial part of the GROMACS topology files and must be carefully prepared to ensure accurate molecular dynamics simulations. It is typically located within the force field directory of GROMACS and can be edited with a text editor or generated using tools provided by GROMACS, such as `pdb2gmx`.
