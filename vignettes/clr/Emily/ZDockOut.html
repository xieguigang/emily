        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h1>File Structure for Molecular Docking Configuration</h1>

<p>## Overview
 
 This document describes the structure of a configuration file used in molecular docking
 simulations, specifically employing the ZDock scoring system. The file format defines
 the parameters and initial conditions for the interaction between a receptor and a ligand
 molecule.
 
 ## File Structure Details
 
 ### Line 1: Grid and Simulation Parameters
 
 The first line contains three essential parameters for the molecular docking simulation:
 
 - <strong>Maximum grid points</strong>: Specifies the size of the grid used for spatial discretization of the molecular interaction space
 - <strong>Grid spacing</strong>: Defines the step size for molecular movement in space, representing the distance between consecutive positions in the search space
 - <strong>Rigid molecule flag</strong>: Set to 0 to indicate that the receptor molecule remains rigid during the docking process
 
 These parameters establish the computational grid that will be used to sample possible
 interactions between the receptor and ligand molecules.
 
 ### Line 2: Receptor Initial Orientation
 
 The second line contains the initial Euler angles of the receptor molecule. These three 
 angles define the initial orientation of the receptor molecule in 3D space before the 
 docking simulation begins.
 
 ### Line 3: Ligand Initial Orientation
 
 The third line contains the initial Euler angles of the ligand molecule. These angles 
 establish the initial orientation of the ligand molecule relative to the receptor at the 
 start of the simulation.
 
 ### Line 4: Receptor Position
 
 The fourth line includes:
 
 - The filename of the receptor molecule file
 - Position parameters that define the receptor's location relative to the coordinate system 
   center, typically represented as Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)
   
 These parameters establish the spatial position of the receptor molecule's center in the simulation space.
 
 ### Line 5: Ligand Initial Position
 
 The fifth line includes:
 
 - The filename of the ligand molecule file
 - Position parameters that define the ligand's initial location relative to the coordinate system center
 
 These parameters establish the starting spatial position of the ligand molecule's center 
 before the docking simulation begins.
 
 ### Subsequent Lines: Docking Conformations and Scores
 
 Each line after the fifth contains information describing a specific conformation and 
 scoring result for the ligand relative to the receptor:
 
 - <strong>First three numbers</strong>: Euler angles representing the rotation of the ligand relative to its initial position
 - <strong>Next three numbers</strong>: Translation vector indicating the linear displacement of the ligand's center relative to its initial position
 - <strong>Last number</strong>: ZDock scoring value, where a higher score indicates better docking quality and a more favorable interaction
 
 These subsequent lines typically represent either:
 
 1. A series of possible docking poses that were evaluated during the simulation
 2. The trajectory of the ligand as it moves through the search space
 
 ## Technical Notes
 
 - The Euler angles are typically represented in radians or degrees, depending on the specific implementation of the docking software
 - The coordinate system is usually Cartesian, with the origin at the center of the receptor binding site
 - The ZDock scoring function combines various energetic and geometric components to evaluate the quality of molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and shape complementarity
 - The grid spacing parameter directly affects the resolution of the search space and computational requirements of the docking simulation
 
 This file format appears to be specific to ZDock or a similar molecular docking
 software package, which is widely used for predicting protein-protein and 
 protein-ligand interactions in computational biology and drug discovery.</p>
